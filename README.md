### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my knowledge in web development, with a focus on modern frameworks and libraries.

ðŸ’» I recently completed a project using the Laravel Filament framework. This project allowed me to explore and implement advanced features, showcasing my ability to work with complex tools and deliver effective solutions.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and web development challenges where I can contribute and learn from experienced developers.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with diving deeper into full-stack development and best practices in web application security.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Java, JavaScript, PHP, AJAX, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Angular, and Laravel.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: barbaracrlp99@gmail.com

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
